## Challenge: add another paragraph
- Can you add a third paragraph of text to your webpage, below the other two?

Remember that your new paragraph should start with a `<p>` tag, and end with `</p>` tag.

Here's how your webpage might look:


<div style="border: 1px solid black; font-family: Arial;">
<p>Hi. My name is Franky.</p>
<p>I like <b>running</b> and <i>riding my bike</i>.</p>
<p>My birthday is on the 30th of June.</p>
</div>


Can you add **bold** and <u>underlined</u> text to your new paragraph? Use `<u>` and `</u>` tags for underlined text.
