## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**, the language used to make webpages. Let's have a look at an example!

You'll be using a website called trinket.io to write HTML code.

+ Open [this trinket](http://jumpto.cc/web-intro){:target="_blank"}.

The project should look like this:

The code that you can see on the left is HTML. On the right of the trinket, you can see the webpage that the HTML code has made.

HTML uses **tags** to build webpages. Look for this HTML code on line 8 of your code:

```html
<p>Hi. My name is Andy.</p>
```

`<p>` is an example of a tag, and is short for **paragraph**. You can start a paragraph with `<p>`, and end a paragraph with `</p>`.

+ Can you spot any other tags?

One other tag you might have spotted is `<b>`, which stands for __bold__:

```html
<b>running</b>
```

Here are some more:

+ `<html>` and `</html>` mark the start and end of the HTML document
+ `<head>` and `</head>` is where stuff like CSS goes (we'll get to that later)
+ `<body>` and `</body>` is where your website content goes

+ Make a change to one of the paragraphs of text in the HTML file (on the left). Click **Run**, and you should see your webpage change (on the right)!

+ If you have made a mistake and want to undo all of your changes, you can click the **menu** button and then click **Reset**.

To undo just the last thing you did, you can press the `Ctrl` and `z` keys together.

### You don't need a Trinket account to save your projects!

If you don't have a Trinket account, click the **down** arrow and then click **Link**. This will give you a link that you can save and come back to later. You'll need to do this every time you make changes, as the link will change!

If you have a Trinket account, the easiest way to save your webpage is to click the **Remix** button on the top of the trinket. This will save a copy of the trinket on your profile.
