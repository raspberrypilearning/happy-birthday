## Making a birthday card

Let's use what you've learnt about HTML and CSS to make your own custom birthday card.

+ Open [this trinket](https://trinket.io/html/b33e4f4ca8){:target="_blank"}.

We've written a lot of code to get you started, but the birthday card looks pretty boring so far, so you're going to make some changes to the HTML and CSS code.

+ Click the button on the front of the card, and you should see it open to reveal the inside.

+ Go to line 14 of the HTML code. Try editing the text to customise your card.

+ Can you find the HTML code for the robot image, and change the word `robot` to `sun`?

+ Look on line 17 to find the code.
+ Change the word `robot` to `sun`, and you'll see the image change!

You can use any of the words `boy`, `diamond`, `dinosaur`, `flowers`, `girl`, `rainbow`, `robot`, `spaceship`, `sun`, `tea`, or `trophy` for a birthday card, or `cracker`, `elf`, `penguin`, `present`, `reindeer`, `santa`, or `snowman` if you would prefer to make a Christmas card.

You can also edit the CSS code of the birthday card.

+ Click on the tab for `style.css`. The first part is all of the CSS styles for the **outside** of the card.

+ Change the `background-color` to `lightgreen`.

+ You can also change the size of an image. Go to the `#outside-pic` CSS code, and change the `width` and `height` of the outside image to `200px` (`px` stands for pixels).

+ The font can be changed too. Go to the `#outside-title` CSS and change the `font-family` to `Comic Sans MS` and the `font-size` to `16pt`.

You can use other fonts, for example:
+ `<span style="font-family: Arial;">arial</span>`
+ `<span style="font-family: impact;">Impact</span>`
+ `<span style="font-family: tahoma;">Tahoma</span>`
